# Introduction
This is yet a very basic Blynk (legacy) project with not much functionality given at this point.

The scope of this and other projects is to ease deployment and debugging for devices that may not be physically accessible during development phase.

The device contacts an OTA Server once after startup to check for updates and self-flash if one is available.
It bridges debugging output to a terminal via a bridge-server (which in my case is included in the same microservice as the OTA-Server).

Linker file modifications are used to not have to worry about renaming binary output after compilation.
The idea is to simply drop the generated `firmware.bin` onto a filesystem the OTA-Server can access.
The OTA Server then can read the raw data at a predefined location and store device and version data in a db or whatever deemed suitable
